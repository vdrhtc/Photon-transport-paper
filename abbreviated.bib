Such schemes are particularly promising for generating nontrivial energy bands and gauge structures in quantum-matter systems. Here, we develop a general formalism that captures the essential features ruling the dynamics: the effective Hamiltonian, but also the effects related to the initial phase of the modulation and the micromotion. This framework allows for the identification of driving schemes, based on general N-step modulations, which lead to configurations relevant for quantum simulation. In particular, we explore methods to generate synthetic spin-orbit couplings and magnetic fields in cold-atom setups.},

@article{Biella2015,
	abstract = {By means of numerical simulations and the input-output formalism, we study photon transport through a chain of coupled nonlinear optical cavities subject to uniform dissipation. Photons are injected from one end of the chain by means of a coherent source. The propagation through the array of cavities is sensitive to the interplay between the photon hopping strength and the local nonlinearity in each cavity. We characterize photon transport by studying the populations and the photon correlations as a function of the cavity position. When complemented with input-output theory, these quantities provide direct information about photon transmission through the system. The position of single-photon and multiphoton resonances directly reflects the structure of the many-body energy levels. This shows how a study of transport along a coupled cavity array can provide rich information about the strongly correlated (many-body) states of light even in presence of dissipation. The numerical algorithm we use, based on the time-evolving block decimation scheme adapted to mixed states, allows us to simulate large arrays (up to 60 cavities). The scaling of photon transmission with the number of cavities does depend on the structure of the many-body photon states inside the array.},

	abstract = {We report a theoretical study of the propagation of electromagnetic waves (EWs) through an array of superconducting qubits, i.e., coherent two-level systems, embedded in a low-dissipation transmission line. We focus on the near-resonant case as the frequency of EWs $\omega$≃$\omega$q, where $\omega$q is the qubit frequency. In this limit we derive the effective dynamic nonlinear wave equation allowing one to obtain the frequency-dependent transmission coefficient of EWs, D($\omega$). In the linear regime and a relatively wide frequency region we obtain a strong resonant suppression of D($\omega$) in both cases of a single qubit and chains composed of a large number of densely arranged qubits. However, in narrow frequency regions a chain of qubits allows the resonant transmission of EWs with greatly enhanced D($\omega$). In the nonlinear regime realized for a moderate power of applied microwave radiation, we predict and analyze various transitions between states characterized by high and low values of D($\omega$). These transitions are manifestations of nonequilibrium steady states of an array of qubits achieved in this regime.},

Within the formalism of projection operators and a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach we develop a one-photon approximation scheme for the calculation of the transmission and reflection factors of the microwave signal in a waveguide which contains an arbitrary number N of noninteracting qubits. We considered in detail the resonances and photon-mediated entanglement for two and three qubits in a chain. We showed that in the non-Markovian case the resonance widths, which define the decay rates of the entangled state, can be much smaller than the decay width of an individual qubit. It is also shown that for identical qubits in the long-wavelength limit a coherent superradiant state is formed with the width being equal to the sum of the widths of spontaneous transitions of N individual qubits. The results obtained in the paper are of general nature and can be applied to any type of qubits. The specific properties of the qubit are only encoded in the two parameters: the qubit energy $\Omega$ and the rate of spontaneous emission $\Gamma$.},

As such, LDE can be considered an elementary precursor of edge modes and topological order. We discuss two possible implementations which simulate open chains with uniform bulk and weak end bonds, either with Ising or with XX nearest-neighbor interactions. In both cases, we discuss a suitable protocol for the adiabatic preparation of the ground state in the physical regimes featuring LDE. In the first case, the adiabatic manipulation and the Ising interactions are realized using dc currents, while in the second case microwaves fields are used to control the smoothness of the transformation and to realize the effective XX interactions. We demonstrate the adiabatic preparation of the end-to-end entanglement in chains of four qubits with realistic parameters and on a relatively fast time scale.},

Here in experiments, we construct a Bose-Hubbard ladder with a ladder array of 20 qubits on a 24-qubit superconducting processor. We investigate theoretically and demonstrate experimentally the dynamics of single- and double-excitation states with distinct behaviors, indicating the uniqueness of the Bose-Hubbard ladder. We observe the linear propagation of photons in the single-excitation case, satisfying the Lieb-Robinson bounds. The double-excitation state, initially placed at the edge, localizes; while placed in the bulk, it splits into two single-excitation modes spreading linearly toward two boundaries, respectively. Remarkably, these phenomena, studied both theoretically and numerically as unique properties of the Bose-Hubbard ladder, are represented coherently by pairs of controllable qubits in experiments. Our results show that collective excitations, as a single mode, are not free. This work paves the way to simulation of exotic logic particles by subtly encoding physical qubits and exploration of rich physics by superconducting circuits.},
